Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) by Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)
% Developed by Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi - July 2023
% The "Group Method of Data Handling" (GMDH) is an algorithmic approach used for modeling and pattern
% recognition in complex systems. It was proposed by the Ukrainian mathematician
% Aleksandr G. Ivakhnenko in 1968. The primary goal of GMDH is to find functional 
% relationships and patterns within a given dataset without making any prior assumptions about 
% the underlying model structure. I used it for SDG. GMDH could be used for
% time series forecasting and more applications. GMDH part is developed by
% Yarpiz. I just modify it for the SDG application.
